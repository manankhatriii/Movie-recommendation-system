# Movie-recommendation-system

In this project, I utilized a movie dataset to build a recommendation system. I performed preprocessing, feature engineering, and data visualizations. I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. I created cluster plots and conducted a grid search for optimizing the Random Forest model. For movie similarity predictions, I employed cosine similarity and a Random Forest classifier.

I developed a Streamlit application that allows users to select a movie from a drop-down list and displays the 10 most similar movies.In this project, I utilized a movie dataset to build a recommendation system.
